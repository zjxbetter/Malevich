    <p>Dear {Reviewee},</p>
    <p>Your <a href="http://{Webserver}/{WebRoot}/default.aspx?cid={MalevichId}">code review for the
       change list {CL}</a> is now very, very old!</p>
    <p>Chances are that the change has already been submitted and you just need to close the review:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;review close {CL}</p>
    <p>Or delete it if the change has been abandoned:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;review delete {CL}</p>
    <p>Otherwise consider reminding your reviewers about it!</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;--  Malevich</p>
