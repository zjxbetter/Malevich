Dear {Reviewee},

Your code review (http://{Webserver}/{WebRoot}/default.aspx?cid={MalevichId}) for the change list {CL} is now very, very old!

Chances are that the change has already been submitted and you just need to close the review:
    review close {CL}

Or delete it if the change has been abandoned:
    review delete {CL}

Otherwise consider reminding your reviewers about it!
